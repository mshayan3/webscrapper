Car dependency is not freedom, it is isolation
I just met a retired couple on the Coast Starlight. In their 50 years of marriage, this is their first travel adventure and they are so excited!
They have been homebodies in Pasadena their whole lives due to persistent eyesight issues that they had thought, until recently, prevented them from traveling
They just discovered trains and audiobooks and are going to make this their life now!

Car dependency is not freedom, it is isolation
I just met a retired couple on the Coast Starlight. In their 50 years of marriage, this is their first travel adventure and they are so excited!
They have been homebodies in Pasadena their whole lives due to persistent eyesight issues that they had thought, until recently, prevented them from traveling
They just discovered trains and audiobooks and are going to make this their life now!
Public transit is the freedom car companies promised us
